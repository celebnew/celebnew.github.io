Only time will tell.</p><h2>The Love Is Blind actor Bartise Bowden was an athlete</h2><p>The 27-year-old Dallas, Texas native will appear in Season 3 of Love is Blind as he embarks on a quest to find a compatible partner with whom he can spend the rest of his life. Bartise places laughter at the top of his list of priorities, according to his Netflix profile. He claims that he is looking for someone who can both “handle all of his jokes” and “crack some back” at him.</p><p>Bartise thinks Stephen and Ayesha Curry make the perfect couple. The biography goes on to say:</p><p>Bartise claims that he is still single because of “pickiness,” and he wants to show that gym-loving people like himself are more “worth” than just their training regimen.</p><p>Bartise participated in sports and played basketball in high school. But due to injuries, he was unable to play, so he started lifting weights about seven years ago. He spoke about his problems in an interview with BodyBuilders.com, saying:</p><p>“I was a high school athlete, and I knew my dreams of playing Division I basketball were over after injuring my ankle in a basketball game my senior year. I transferred to a D-3 school to play basketball, but I had to have another operation after breaking my second ankle and gave up the sport.</p><p>He claimed that he has found harmony between his physical and mental well-being thanks to his passion of weightlifting. When he was twenty years old, he started lifting weights. Bartise said in an interview from 2019:</p><p>“About four years ago, when I was 20 years old, I started lifting weights. I got caught up in the process. I’m addicted to improvement on a physical, psychological, and emotional level. I find it fascinating how controlling and maintaining our diets and workout routines can drastically affect our bodies.</p><p>Bartise earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Science in Accounting from The University of Texas at Dallas, both in 2017. Prior to working as an Audit Associate in 2020 and a Senior Associate in 2021 before joining a healthcare company as a Senior Analyst, he worked as an Audit Intern and Accounting Tutor from 2017 to 2018.</p><p>On his Instagram stories, Bartise gives a preview of Love is Blind Season 3:</p><p>When I’m 85 years old, this won’t be around [self-poking] in sixty years. Instead of what I appear to be on the outside, I want someone to value who I really am on the inside.</p><p>Love is Blind’s third season is almost here. The Nick and Vanessa Lachey-hosted episodes will feature cast members meeting their future spouses and proposing to them. On Wednesday, Love is Blind’s third season will debut on Netflix.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Juan Williams Of Fox News Quits The Five! 43 Years Married Life</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Entertainment</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is Whitney Scott Mathers?
