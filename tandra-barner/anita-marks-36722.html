The squad is a member of the Women’s Football Alliance, a full-contact American Football league that is the largest of three comparable leagues for women in the United States. They are headquartered in Miami, Florida, and play their games at the North Miami Athletic Stadium. She was a professional player for four years, spending the majority of her time with the Fury.</p><p>During her final season, though, she signed with the Florida Stingrays, an amateur team in the United Football Federation of America. They were an expansion team of the American Indoor Football Association before joining that league, and they now play their games at Rutenberg Park. During her tenure with the team, they won the WPFL championship in 2003.

During her stint there, she co-hosted a show that was also aired on MASN-TV. This led to her working with MASN as well, where she hosted her own Fantasy Football show called “Fantasy Blitz.” Her television experience led to her becoming a sideline reporter for the United Football League, with the majority of her broadcasts aired on the Versus network.</p><p>Anita then relocated to New York to join the New York Giants broadcast team, as well as host for numerous networks, including MSG, WWOR-TV My9, and Verizon Fios.
