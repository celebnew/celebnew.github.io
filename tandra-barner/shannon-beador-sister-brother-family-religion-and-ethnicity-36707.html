She started the show in 2014 and quickly rose to the top of the cast rankings in terms of popularity and controversy. Throughout the series, Shannon’s lifestyle and marriage were the focus of several plotlines.</strong></p><p>Along with becoming a successful businesswoman, she founded the prepared food line Real for Real Cuisine. The TV personality has also appeared on several episodes of the shopping channel QVC and has partnered with them to market her merchandise.</p><p>She also supports philanthropic causes like the JDRF, the Alzheimer’s Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Orange County Rescue Mission, and the American Cancer Society.</p><h2><span id=The_brother_and_sister_of_Shannon_Beador>The brother and sister of Shannon Beador</span></h2><p>The TV personality was raised in an affluent home and is gifted with two siblings. She has a strong relationship with them, even though she rarely brings them up in interviews or public. Her touching social media posts attest to this. Shannon is a family woman who values her relationships with her loved ones and always puts their needs first. She uploaded a nice picture to her social media in November 2016.</p><p>A sweet moment with Shannon Beador’s brother and sister was captured in the picture. The three siblings, who were wearing casual black clothing, looked happy in the picture. She wrote in the photo’s caption that she loved spending time with her sister and brother. She also said that it is even more meaningful because the three of them haven’t been together in years.</p><p>Shannon Beador’s brother and sister don’t seem to be in the public eye like she is, thus nothing is known about their careers and professional lives. In that instance, finding out the whereabouts and occupation of Shannon’s siblings is difficult.</p><h2><span id=Religion_and_Ethnicity_of_the_Shannon_Beador_Family>Religion and Ethnicity of the Shannon Beador Family</span></h2><p>Shannon Beador is quoted as saying that she is a Christian. The reality TV star talked on social media about her daughter Sophie’s wish to get baptized. Despite her misgivings about Christianity, Sophie decided to get baptized after developing an interest in it. Her mother was happy with her choice, and she quickly informed her admirers of it. Shannon added that when Sophie was younger, she insisted on not attending church.</p><p>Shannon was proud of her little daughter for choosing to be baptized, calling the event that evening “the most incredible.” Beador regularly highlights her faith in Christianity and her religion in her posts on social media. She values her daughter’s commitment to Jesus Christ and believes that God has a purpose for every one of us. Lastly, Ms. Shannon hails from California in the United States and has mixed ancestry.</p><h2><span id=The_husband_and_daughter_of_Shannon_Beador>The husband and daughter of Shannon Beador</span></h2><p>In 2000, Shannon wed her ex-husband, well-known construction industry owner David Beador. The three children of the couple were raised in Newport Beach, California. The older daughter, Sophie, was born in 2001, while the twins, Adeline and Stella, were born in 2004. Shannon committed to devoting all of her time to being a wife and mother, while David ran his massive company.</p><p>Their seemingly idyllic marriage and family life took a turn for the worse in 2014 when David came clean about having an affair. After an acrimonious legal battle over custody, spousal support, and wealth distribution, they split in April 2019. Shannon’s three grown children are shown in the majority of the reality TV personality’s Instagram photos. The daughters and their mother appear to have a close relationship based on their social media accounts.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>TV celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Eric Gordon Girlfriend | Is He Married Or Dating Anyone | NBA Player Relationship</a></h3>Eric Gordon's Girlfriend: Eric has kept a low-key personality, especially in his personal life.
