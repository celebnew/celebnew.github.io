It is about giving failure new meaning and overcoming the negativity that accompanies the idea of failure.</p><p>In her declaration of triumph, Tara stated:</p><p><strong>I’ve been able to give students scholarships through #YesYouCan and assist others in acquiring the abilities necessary to persevere in the face of some of life’s most challenging obstacles. I genuinely want to change the way we view failure and turn it into a chance for growth rather than something to be terrified of.</strong></p><p>She continued by saying that one of the best things about her curriculum is that everyone can relate to it and benefit from it, regardless of their age, background, or demographic. She continued by saying that she intended to distribute it to all Georgian schools. In addition, Tara credited her own tenacity for helping her succeed, saying:</p><p><strong>“I learned the value of perseverance when I was 11 years old because I participated in a competition and it took me nine years to win.” It taught me how to set small goals and accomplish with them. It showed me why the journey itself is far more important than the end result.</strong></p><h2><span id=Miss_Georgia_Teen_2023_was_crowned_on_the_same_day_Miss_Georgia_2023_was>Miss Georgia Teen 2023 was crowned on the same day Miss Georgia 2023 was</span></h2><p>Miss Spirit of the South Julia DeSerio came in as the first runner-up, but Miss Georgia 2023 Tara Schiphof took home the crown.
