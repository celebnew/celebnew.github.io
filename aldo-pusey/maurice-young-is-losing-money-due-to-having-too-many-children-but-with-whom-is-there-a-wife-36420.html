Is There A Wife?</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-05-07</div><p><strong>Maurice Young, commonly known as Trick Daddy, has been a well-known face since the release of his hits I’m a Thug and I’m So Hood in the early 2000s. The Miami rapper’s professional life is also accessible to the public, but this does not suggest anything about his personal life.</strong></p><p>Trick Daddy was left with his children and heaps of bills from his babies’ mothers after multiple romances failed.</p><h2><span id=Maurice_Young_Has_Children_and_a_Wife><strong>Maurice Young</strong> Has Children and a Wife?</span></h2><p>In terms of Trick’s personal life, the musician has 10 children and was married to a hairstylist named Joy. Although the date and location of their marriage have not been revealed, the couple split up in 2014 but have not been legally divorced.</p><h2><span id=Daddy_Plays_a_Joke_on_His_Ex-Wife>Daddy Plays a Joke on His Ex-Wife</span></h2><p>Trick Daddy, who appeared on Love & Hip Hop Miami in 2018, was forced to confront his estranged wife in one of the episodes. Trick came face to face with Joy as he was going to enter a club. He made every attempt to avoid her, but it would have been impolite to ignore the birthday girl on her special day. As a result, he engaged in a casual discussion to avoid appearing haughty.</p><p>Trick even accused Joy of abandoning him without a solid reason on the air. Joy had previously shown dissatisfaction with the relationship, to which Trick responded by declaring that he had given her everything money could buy.</p><p>Trick and Joy, on the other hand, have moved on and are on their way to finalizing their divorce.</p><p>Following this, his publicly known relationship was with Trina, whom he was seen in his song ‘Nann.’</p><p>In 2017, Trick was also rumored to be dating his wife’s cousin Trina. The two initially appeared in Trick’s Nann music video. Later, in a March 2017 interview, Trick stated that he and Trina had signed a joint album titled “Trick & Trina,” which sparked relationship rumors.</p><p>Trick Daddy has had relationships with eight other women and has ten children from his affairs. In December 2017, his tenth child was born, joining his other nine children.</p><h2><span id=The_Fight_Against_an_Incurable_Disease>The Fight Against an Incurable Disease</span></h2><p>Back in 2009, as Trick was preparing to release his autobiography, he revealed that he was suffering from Lupus, an incurable disease. All major organs in the body, including the heart, nervous system, and kidneys, are affected by the autoimmune disease. Trick stated in a 2009 interview about his health condition,</p><p>“I saw a doctor about 12 years ago.” He took all of the brains of the testers, and because I was trying to get rid of what we call dry skin, she performed biopsies and blood tests on me. She informed me that I have Lupus. The sun is my worst enemy because I am extremely allergic to it. It’s similar to an AK-47 with a double clip. The procedure and drugs could put my kidney and liver function at risk.”</p><p>Maurice Young went on to say,</p><p>“Many individuals try to conceal it with conventional make-up.” It causes pigmentation of the skin. You can transition from dark to light and vice versa. You must cover it up and conceal it… My mother had 11 children by ten different guys. I know if she can live with that, I can live with this.”</p><p>Maurice Young also claimed that he had quit taking pharmaceuticals after the initial phase of treatment owing to all of the adverse effects.</p><p>Trick eventually accepted his illness and learned to live with an incurable ailment. He contended that if his mother could endure the agony of giving birth to 11 children from ten men, he could learn to live with a single sickness.</p><h2><span id=From_car_collection_to_bankruptcy>From car collection to bankruptcy</span></h2><p>Earlier in his career, the 44-year-old rapper was known for his extensive collection of expensive automobiles. However, he has been struggling to make ends meet throughout the years.</p><p>In August 2015, the Miami native declared bankruptcy because he had too many expenses to pay and his bank balance was close to nothing. Trick stated that, despite having assets worth $430k in his name, he was in debt for more than $645k. He owed $34,837 in child support to one of his former girlfriends, $22,282 to another, $280k for his first mortgage, and $290k to the IRS for late taxes.</p><p>Even while he could still earn around $15,000 per month from royalties and club appearances, he could only spend $550 per month on jewelry and clothes due to all of his debts. And, according to sources, his net worth is around $100,000.</p><p>As of 2018, he has recovered from his financial difficulties and now has a net worth of $100,000, which allows him to provide for his children.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Tom Stenberg</a>, <a href=#>Cyrus Michael Christopher Dancy</a>, and <a href=#>Morgane Stapleton</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Rapper</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jay Rock</a></h3>Jay Rock estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
