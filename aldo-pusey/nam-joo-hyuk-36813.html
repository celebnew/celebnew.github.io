He rose to prominence in the profession as a model, but he eventually established himself as an actor. Since his arrival, this dashing Asian has been causing havoc in the sector.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Nam_Joo_Hyuk_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Nam Joo Hyuk? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Obviously, this model-turned-actor is well compensated for his outstanding work. He makes money via photoshoots, brand sponsorships, marketing campaigns, and other activities. As a result, Nam’s <strong>net worth</strong> is expected to be $64 million by 2022.</p><p>Taking into account his work, this sum looks to be relatively tiny in comparison to his work and commitment to show business. Because Hyuk is only 26 years old, this is only the beginning; there will be more, and admirers can’t get enough of his work.</p><p>Furthermore, his great performance in blockbuster films and television shows allows him to boost his income. Even his Instagram posts bring in a modest amount of money for his bank account. Nam’s charitable activities, in addition to his vocation, never ceases to astound followers.</p><p>On April 6, 2019, Hyuk donated roughly 30 million won to the Hope Bridge Association of National Disaster Relief for victims of the Gangwon Province wildfire in South Korea. This act suggests that this young man has a big heart.</p><h2><span id=Nam_Joo_Hyuk-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Nam Joo Hyuk- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>This charming beauty was born in South Korea’s lovely city of Busan. Nam’s fundamental requirements were covered by his family when he was growing up in Korea’s capital city. His family was always there for him when it comes to his work and passion. That could explain why he’s made a reputation for himself as an actor and model.</p><p>Unfortunately, their identities and whereabouts have not been revealed to the public. We will make it available to the public as soon as possible. This beautiful model appears to be the family’s lone child. Without a doubt, he was lavished with affection and attention. Hyuk is also Korean by nationality and Asian by ethnicity.</p><p>This lovely model attends Gyeongnam Middle School for her schooling. He desired to be a professional basketball player at the time. Hyuk was also a member of a basketball squad for nearly three years.</p><p>Nam was later wounded and required surgery and his dream of becoming a basketball player was dashed before it had begun. Life isn’t always as good or as flawless as we expect, but every now and again, the result is out of this world.</p><h2><span id=Nam_Joo_Hyuk-_Relationship_Girlfriend>Nam Joo Hyuk- Relationship, Girlfriend</span></h2><p>For young females who can’t get enough Korean music and dramas, this can be a significant letdown. This handsome was in a love relationship with Lee Sung Kyung, whether happily or sadly. Not to mention the fact that she is an actor.</p><p>They fell in love when they ran into one other on the set of Weightlifting Fairy Kim bok-Joo. Their romantic chemistry, closeness, and unique aura in the play were all the outcomes of their connection from the beginning.</p><p>All of this, however, occurred in 2016. The couple separated after a few months, according to their agency, YG Entertainment, since they had an extremely busy schedule. Isn’t it a heartbreaking situation?</p><p>Nam’s love snapshot is still on his social media, which is surprising. Fans are praying for their reunion as soon as possible.</p><h2><span id=Nam_Joo_Hyuk-_Professional_Career>Nam Joo Hyuk- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Hyuk initially came to Seoul to further his career. He eventually entered the Top Model competition, which was sponsored by K-Plus. Surprisingly, he won the competition and received a modeling deal.</p><p>In 2013, this tall man modeled for the SONGZIO Homme 2014 S/S collection. As a result of the favorable comments he received, he was able to move on to his next duty. In 2014, Nam participated in the music videos “Giving Love to Fellow” and “200 percent.” Life, on the other hand, had different ideas for this Korean beauty.</p><p>In November 2017, Hyuk inked a contract with Penshoppe. Then he became the face and brand ambassador for a well-known clothing company. On April 17, 2019, this cute model was officially announced as the brand ambassador for Dior Men in Asia.</p><p>Who would have predicted that the man striding down the runway would end up in a film or television show? In the KBS teen drama Who Are You: School 2015, he made his first appearance in the entertainment world. After a year, he debuted as a supporting character in Cheese in the Trap, a high school romance series.</p><p>Soon Nam has appeared in several television shows, including Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo, Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok-Joo (2016), The Bride of Habaek (2017), Dazzling (2019), The School Nurse Files (2020), Startup (2020), Here (2020), and many more. Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok-statuesque Joo’s figure also wowed fans.</p><p>In terms of films, Hyuk starred as Sa-mool in the box office smash The Great Battle (2018). His talent and originality impressed even more of their admirers. As time passed, he was cast as Tsuneo in the film Josee (2020).</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Hyuk stands <strong>6 feet 1.5 inches (186.5 cm)</strong> tall and is a model and actor. This height is considered remarkable in the fashion world. He has kept his weight stable at <strong>163 pounds (74 kg)</strong>.</p><p>Fans of Kim’s Bok-film Joo’s Weightlifting Fairy are well aware of Nam’s physique. His slim, toned body is suited for the job of a swimmer. He didn’t shy away from flashing his abs amid the controversy. Regrettably, no credible information on his vital data is available.</p><p>Because he spends so much time in front of the camera, he takes care of his body. As a result, he visits the gym on a regular basis. His impressive six-pack abs are the consequence of hard work and sweat put in on a regular basis.</p><p>To summarize his appearance, he has black hair with a front bang that is precisely cut. The monolid set of black eyes is also worth a glance. His white skin tone goes well with any designer’s outfit.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>We’ve all witnessed how Korean celebrities can make us want to dance and sing along to the song. Nam’s ardent admirers are surely active on social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and others.</p><p>Her Instagram account has 11 million followers.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Abilio James Acosta</a>, <a href=#>Ladd Drummond</a>, and <a href=#>Ryans Williams</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Model</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Irina Voronina</a></h3>Irina Voronina estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
