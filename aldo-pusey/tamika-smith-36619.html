As a result, the rest of the world was unaware of their wedding plans.</p><p>Tamika and Method Man had three children together. Their names, on the other hand, aren’t readily available on the internet.</p><p>Method Man, who is protective of his wife, was enraged when Wendy Williams announced Tamika was having cancer treatment. Tamika and Method Man had kept her diagnosis a secret until that time. Wendy also alleged that Method Man had an affair with her and a doctor who helped Tamika with her cancer.</p><p>Method Man, unsurprisingly, rejected all of Wendy’s charges. Meanwhile, other publications reported that the rapper and former video vixen Modest Jones had a kid outside of marriage. Method Man allegedly cheated on Tamika with Karrine “Superhead” Steffans, according to a few blogs.</p><p>The purported affair arose in late January 2021, on the day of Wendy Williams’ biography. Wendy talked about their one-night stand at the time, claiming that the rapper would deny it.</p><p>Tamika, who was fed up with Wendy’s relentless provocation, resorted to Instagram to address the charges. “For years, I remained silent as Wendy Williams launched incessant verbal attacks against my husband, myself, and our family…” continued the statement. In a clear attempt to boost ratings for her depressing biopic, faltering TV program, and burnt-out career… Wendy has once again demonstrated that she is incapable of any decency… Her career is on life support, her husband has abandoned her, and all of her projects are receiving low ratings.”</p><p>“For the record, my marriage is stable, my husband continues to enjoy a thriving profession, and Wendy will forever remain one of the most miserable bitches on the planet,” Tamika wrote at the end of her statement.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>ASSISTANT</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Erica Washington</a></h3>Erica Washington estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
