As a result, discussing his wife was pointless. However, he was undoubtedly seeing a few wife candidates on and off-screen. Xolo Mariduea’s name was linked to several television show beauties. And one of the most recent was the co-star of Cobra Kai Hannah Kepple. Hannah is most well-known for her portrayal of Moon on the show.</p><p>After they began filming the show, the pair became closer. However, it appears as though the couple also confirmed their relationship publicly by ceasing to see each other.</p><p>As previously reported, Hannah confirmed her relationship with Xolo exclusively during an interview with MEAWW. Additionally, she stated that she and Xolo became friends, the relationship quickly became flirtatious, and they began communicating following season 1.</p><p>However, Xolo and Hannah rarely appeared in public together, which aided in maintaining their relationship’s secrecy. While discussing Xolo’s on-screen love interest, we couldn’t leave out Peyton List’s Tory Nichols and Sam LaRusso, the daughter of Daniel LaRusso, the original Karate Kid.</p><p>Following the alleged breakup of the pair, Xolo allegedly began dating another Cobra Kai co-star, Mary Mouser. However, the rumor was denied because she was dating Brett Pierce at the time. Additionally, Zayka Noelle is included on Xolo’s previous list of women he dated. She rose to prominence as the star of an American web series.</p><p>Zayka made her YouTube debut in March 2013 with KIDS REACT TO HARLEM SHAKE. She is also an aspiring Instagram celebrity, with a total of over 250k followers.</p><h2><span id=Regarding_Xolo_Mariduea_Gay_Cobra_Kai_Miguel>Regarding Xolo Mariduea Gay, Cobra Kai, Miguel</span></h2><p>Since Xolo Mariduea’s on-screen appearance as Miguel in Cobra Kai (2018-2021), a sizable cult of the show’s fans has wished he was gay. Numerous fans voiced their support for the decision to make the protagonist gay.</p><p>Some fans insisted on the show’s need for a gay lead for it to work. While one fan criticized the show’s theme of toxic masculinity, another stated that Miguel’s homosexuality provides a nice contrast. Some have even suggested that the two share violent energy that serves as the basis for their romantic relationship and sexual tension.</p><p>Thus, despite the show’s fans’ wishes, neither Miguel nor Xolo Mariduea, who played Miguel, is gay.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Philippe Forquet</a></h3>Philippe Forquet estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
